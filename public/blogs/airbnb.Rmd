# Introduction
Airbnb is a vacation rental online marketplace based in San Francisco, California. Founded in 2008, the company has skyrocketed in popularity, with a private valuation of $18 billion and a plan to potentially go public within the year. 
The scope of this work, is to analyse data about Airbnb listings and fit a model to predict the total cost for two people staying 4 nights in an AirBnB in Singapore. 

We begin with exploratory data analysis and mapping of the key insights from the dataset before running various analyses. We then analyse our final results and wrap it up in our conclusion.

***
# Exploratory Data Analysis
The aim of this section is to gain a better understanding of our data set. To do this, we utilize a variety of tools, such as data visualizations and correlation matrices. Our dataset comes from insideairbnb.com, and represent official AirBnb data. 

***
## Raw Data
We have a look at our raw data, after selecting the attributes from the table that we want to use in this analyse.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# Importing listings dataset
singapore <- vroom("http://data.insideairbnb.com/singapore/sg/singapore/2020-06-22/data/listings.csv.gz") %>% 
    clean_names()

#select the variables that will be used for analysis
singapore_listings <- singapore %>% 
  
  select(price, 
         cleaning_fee, 
         extra_people, 
         property_type, 
         room_type,
         minimum_nights,
         number_of_reviews, 
         review_scores_rating,
         review_scores_location,
         longitude, 
         latitude, 
         neighbourhood, 
         neighbourhood_group_cleansed,
         zipcode,
         host_is_superhost,
         is_location_exact,
         cancellation_policy,
         host_response_time,
         host_acceptance_rate,
         security_deposit,
         accommodates,
         bedrooms)

dplyr::glimpse(singapore_listings)

```
***
## Computing Summary Statistics

Let's compute the summary statistics for our data and desired variables. This will give us an idea about data size, variable types, missing and unique values to begin with. For numeric data, we also see the mean and standard deviation which helps guide the analysis.

```{r}
#calculate summary statistics and observe missing values if any
skimr::skim(singapore_listings)
```

In the figure above, we can see the summary statics of the selected variables and their rough distributions. By inspecting the distributions, all variables seem to be heavily skewed, which could potentially signify the existence of extreme data points, which will be dealt with in the next part.

***
## Data Wrangling and Handling Missing Values
After having selected the variables of interest, we need to clean up the dataset to prepare it for analysis. We begin by handling the missing data, transforming price data to numerical values, visualising the distribution of our dependent variable, then price and filtering out extreme data.

```{r}
singapore_listings <- singapore_listings %>%
  
  #convert all prices to numeric values
  mutate(price = parse_number(price), 
         cleaning_fee = parse_number(cleaning_fee),
         extra_people = parse_number(extra_people),
         security_deposit = parse_number(security_deposit)) %>%
  
  #replace all NA values for cleaning fee and security deposit to the numeric price 0
  mutate(cleaning_fee = case_when(is.na(cleaning_fee) ~ 0, TRUE ~ cleaning_fee)) %>% 
  mutate(security_deposit = case_when(is.na(security_deposit) ~ 0, TRUE ~ security_deposit))

```

***
## Data Filtering

After looking at the above shown figures, we chose to filter the following variables:

1. Minimum nights to <= 4 nights
2. Price to <= $1500
3. Cleaning fee <= $200
4. Fee for extra people <= $100

Moreover, we determined the top 5 property types and allocated all other types into an "other" category.

```{r}

#Finding the most listed property types
top_property_types <- singapore_listings %>% 
  group_by(property_type) %>% 
  summarise(count = count(property_type)) %>% 
  top_n(5)

#Adding column for the top 5 property types and categorising the rest as 'Other'
filtered_listings <- singapore_listings %>%
  mutate(prop_type_simplified = case_when(
    property_type %in% c("Apartment","Condominium", "Hostel","House", "Serviced apartment") ~ property_type, 
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

# Filter dataframe by minimum nights <= 4
filtered_listings <- filtered_listings %>% 
  filter(minimum_nights <= 4, price <= 1500, cleaning_fee <= 200, extra_people <= 100)

```

# Mapping
Singapore is a vibrant touristic city-state with the largest port by throughput consistently since 2015. Below we map AirBnbs in singapore with respect to their geographical location, depicting their price range.

```{r}

#mapping visualisation for listings by price
pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "RdBu", domain = c(-100:1000))

map_1 <- leaflet(data = filtered_listings) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   radius = 1, 
                   color = ~pal(price), 
                   fillOpacity = 0.4, 
                   label = ~price) %>% 
   addLegend("bottomright", pal = pal, values = ~price,
    title = "Price",
    labFormat = labelFormat(prefix = "$"),
    opacity = 1
  )
map_1
```

***
The second step would be to map airbnb listing by neighbourhood. The neighbourhoods in Singapore are grouped into 5 regions - Cetral, East, North-East, North and West. This map gives us an idea of the most popular or crowded region having maximum number of listings. 

When compared with the map above, it also gives insights of how various regions are priced.

```{r}
#color by neighborhood
pal <- colorFactor(palette = c("#484848", "#FC642D", "#767676", "#00A699", "#FF5A5F"), 
               levels = c("North-East Region", "North Region", "East Region", "West Region", "Central Region"))

map_2 <- leaflet(data = filtered_listings) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   radius = 1, 
                   color = ~pal(neighbourhood_group_cleansed), 
                   fillOpacity = 0.4, 
                   label = ~neighbourhood_group_cleansed) %>% 
   addLegend("bottomright", pal = pal, values = ~neighbourhood_group_cleansed,
    title = "Neighbourhood",
    opacity = 1
  )
map_2 
```

***
We further map the number of airbnb listings for each property type. The property types we've used here are the filtered ones i.e. the 5 most popular properties are taken and the rest are categorised under one group named 'other'.

```{r}
#color by property type
pal <- colorFactor(palette = c("#e98a15", "#a2ad59", "#1D3461", "#538083", "#a53860"), 
               levels = c("Apartment","Condominium", "Hostel","House", "Serviced apartment"))

map_3 <- leaflet(data = filtered_listings) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   radius = 1, 
                   color = ~pal(prop_type_simplified), 
                   fillOpacity = 0.5, 
                   label = ~prop_type_simplified) %>% 
     addLegend("bottomright", pal = pal, values = ~prop_type_simplified,
    title = "Property",
    opacity = 1
  )
map_3

```

***
# Conclusions 
As expected, the majority of airbnb listings are located in the city-center, with higher prices predominantly in the area. Moreover, larger accommodation types such as hostels are also concentrated in the city center. 

On the contrary, the northern part of Singapore seems to be significantly less developed and less touristic, as the number of listings is lower.
