title: About Me
---

I'm 21 years old, born and brought up in India and have spent most of my time growing up in Mumbai, a city we also call _the city of dreams_.

I obtained a B.Tech in Computer Science in 2020 and during the course of engineering grew inclined towards the field of Data Science. Exploring this area, I've worked on various projects and successfully published two research papers in the prestigious IEEE Xplore:

* [Detection and Prevention of Cervical Cancer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9033800)
* [Cataract Detection using Digital Image Processing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8978316)

In the months following my graduation, I worked as a _Business Technology Associate_ to update my skills and gather real life exposure. Soon after, I began my journey as an Analytics and Management Masters student at London Business School.  

Some of the key activities apart from my work and studies that define me are canvas painting, journalling and meditating. I love taking up small art projects during holidays and my art is some of my most prized work.
