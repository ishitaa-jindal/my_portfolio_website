## A little about me  ##

Hello greetings! I'm 22 years old, born in India and brought up in Mumbai, a city we also call _the city of dreams_. By training, I'm a Computer Science Engineer but I also like to call myself a passionate artist and data science enthusiast! 

My projects and paintings are things that I treasure as they are like mini-achievements; something nice created from scratch using creativity! This is why I've invested time in this website - to share some of my most prized work:)

Some of the activities apart from my work and studies that define me are canvas painting, listening to music (and also shower-singing), reading (philosophy and psychology), journalling and meditating.

The mantra that's been carrying me through life is that you can achieve anything with consistency and collaboration!

## Background and experience ##

Since my engineering days, I've been trying to find ways to solve real-world problems using the power of science and this began with research in the field of analytics and health-care. The research resulted in two published papers which you can find here (if research and long texts interest you)-

* [Detection and Prevention of Cervical Cancer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9033800)
* [Cataract Detection using Digital Image Processing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8978316)

During internships in the retail and energy sector, I got the opportunity to work with a range of cool tools and technologies including programming languages, visualization softwares, web development tools and also cloud platforms!

In the months following graduation, I worked as an Associate at a consulting firm to learn the business aspect of things and gather real life exposure.

## Where I am now ##

Currently I'm pursuing a Masters at London Business School in the UK and alongside working at a health-tech start-up as a Strategy intern. I have grown to like the business analytics and product development aspect of companies more and more, and look forward to pursue a career in that direction.
